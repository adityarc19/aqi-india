------

I have taken an AQI dataset from Kaggle and performed some EDA on it as well as implemented a decision tree classiifer to classify the air quality into one of the six buckets:
1. Good
2. Moderate
3. Satisfactory
4. Poor
5. Very Poor
6. Severe


* The dataset is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india).
* It contains air quality data and AQI (Air Quality Index) at hourly and daily level of various stations across multiple cities in India.
